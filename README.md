# SeleniumFbFun - A Unique 'Facebook Story Personalizer' Automation Tool

A small personal automation project geared towards solving an inconvenience caused due to a missing feature in ‘Facebook story privacy’ settings menu. In the ‘custom’ option under ‘settings’ menu (where you can select each individual ‘friend’ to share the story with), the menu comes with all friends being pre-selected and NO ‘select/unselect all’ options. So if a facebook user wants to share some story with only specific people of his/her desire, he/she has to manually unselect all friends one by one, then select the only desired friends. The automation tool takes care this whole manual process for you. You just provide username and password, it will take of the rest the process. It will open up browser for you, login to your facebook account for you, open up story privacy settings, change settings to ‘custom’, unselect all friends even if you have thousands of friends, then will save settings. You can now easily go to the settings menu and select only the desired friends to share a story.
